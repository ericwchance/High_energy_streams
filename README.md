Global Identification of High Energy Streams with Google Earth Engine
Abstract:
A viable method to identify high energy stream segments on a global scale using the 
Google Earth Engine API was developed. This analysis is intended to identify stream 
segment and significant geographic features that for reasons such as inaccessible 
terrain or remoteness are largely unexplored in order to identify areas that may be 
suitable for whitewater recreation, hydropower development or resource conservation. 
Using 15 arc second resolution digital elevation model and flow accumulation data, high 
energy river sections (those with large flows and high gradient) were successfully 
identified. Stream gradient was determined through a neighborhood analysis of 3x3 and 
5x5 cell squares, performed through a manual shifts of the DEM dataset. The accuracy 
of this analysis is limited by several factors, primarily the coarse resolution and errors 
within the DEM dataset and the difficulty of performing neighborhood based analysis in 
the Earth Engine environment, addition of these functions to Earth Engine could 
significantly improve its functionality for terrain based analysis.
